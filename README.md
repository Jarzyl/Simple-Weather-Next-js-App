I took inspiration from 'Code Commerce' and built Next JS weather app following his tutorial. I want to understand and learn how to use the API so I thought it's worth starting with something simple but useful.

About project

This simple application fetches weather information from Open Weather Map API servers and return JSON data which is displayed on the homepage. After entering the name of the city, the user can see the weather icon, temperature, sensed temperature, air humidity, wind speed, pressure and country for the selected city. Styling was done using Tailwind CSS. I modified the visual side, added a responsive logo, and added responsiveness to the entire application. I added additional information about the city and pressure. I also added validation for values entered in the search bar, displaying an error when the user enters the wrong city name or an incorrect string of characters, and cleaning the search bar after entering the city name and displaying information, as well as a welcome message for the visitor.
